# Testproject

## Success
If you can read this (on GitHub) the **mirroring** works fine.

## Override?
YES. Of course, everything one would now update on the GitHUB side will be **overridden** with the next update from GitLab.

## Introduction
This is only an example of a readme file which is useful

## Overview
Here could be an overview of everything that my software/code:
- is for
- can do
- needs help with
- and a roadmap perhaps

## Documentation
Here I would like to see [links](https://wikipedia.de) to :point_right:
- all further documentation
- teams (if any)
- Wiki
- and nothing

## Connect
And last but not least: Here comes a list of social media channels and communities elsewhere. :sunny: Add an image or Emoji here and there :+1:
- [Project XY on Telegram](https://t.me)
- [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com)
- Meet the project team and founders on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)

## License
I would probably always include a license file in every repository. Then everybody knows exactly what they can and can not do with your code. And I'd use GitHub standard templates to create one (then link to it from here): [How to add a License to your repo](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/)
